    <p body>{{'The Computer Science department of the Seidenberg School reviewed and revised the Master of Science in Computer Science in fall 2011. Since then, the department has been offering a 30-credit program that has been both strengthened and updated.

      The new rigorous curriculum is built on a core of algorithms and computing theory, Internet and web computing, grid and cloud computing, and database systems. It also offers students the flexibility of pursuing one or more focused, in-depth course sequences in cutting-edge areas like classical computer science, artificial intelligence, Internet computing, mobile computing, network security, and web security.

      Whether you are looking to advance your career or change focus and keep ahead of the latest technologies, this master's program is your best choice.
